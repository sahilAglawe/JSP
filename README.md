# JSP & Servlet Concepts – Quick Summary

## 1. Scripting Elements
Java code written inside a JSP page using scriptlet, expression, or declaration tags.

## 2. Implicit Objects
Predefined objects in JSP like `request`, `response`, `session`, `out` that simplify data handling.

## 3. Directives
Instructions to the JSP engine such as `page`, `include`, and `taglib` to control page behavior.

## 4. Action Elements
JSP XML-based tags (`<jsp:useBean>`, `<jsp:include>`, `<jsp:forward>`) used for dynamic runtime operations.

## 5. UseBean
JSP mechanism to create or access JavaBean objects and use setters/getters inside JSP.

## 6. JSP MVC Architecture
A design pattern separating application into Model (logic), View (JSP UI), and Controller (Servlet).

## 7. Data Access Object (DAO)
A layer that contains all database operations, separating business logic from data logic.
